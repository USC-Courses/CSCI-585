Assumptions:
1. There might have several instances for the same class or project.
2. Every student could choose one of the instance of the same class or project.
3. Textbooks may not exist in the library, teachers can use textbooks that are not in the library.
4. The microcontroller used in a project is contained in the box of the table.

I use many types to distinguish different entities in the same table.
Such as TARGET_ID is a type to distinguish the target of grading.
Whether an instance is a class or a project depends on the value of INSTANCE_TYPE.
